* duck - Search quickly in duckduckgo using lynx
* fixdualmonitor - fix a strange issue with my dual monitor where it doesn't come back online from sleep
* notes - Note taking tool. Opens markdown file at ~/workspace/notes/[name].md. Has commands to edit/preview/delete notes
* pomo - A pomodoro clock to show in the top bar which can notify when the time is up
* publicip- show public ip on the network. Useful to print on polybar/i3bar etc
* push - git push -u origin head
